# Comprehensive Study of IoT Malware Classification Models: Insights into Temporal, Architectural, and Spatial Inconsistency Challenges

The repository is for the paper **Comprehensive Study of IoT Malware Classification Models: Insights into Temporal, Architectural, and Spatial Inconsistency Challenges**. It includes the source code for evaluation on IoT malware classification models under the challenge of temporal, architectural, and spatial inconsistency.

The evaluation is performed using the [IoTPot](https://sec.ynu.codes/iot/) Dataset. To ensure privacy, this repository does not contain the malware samples. Additionally, files that exceed the size limitations, such as the best-trained models and extracted features, are not included. The repository primarily consists of the source code and analysis results. 

The folder and file descriptions of the repository are as follows:

- **malFcYASEval/**
